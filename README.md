CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition:
Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
